      "lastSummary": "**Proposal: Create a Secure System Update Checker**\n\nBased on the prescan summary, the most critical issue is the system's inability to check for its own OS-level updates. This is a major gap in security and stability monitoring.\n\n*   **Impact:** This feature will close a significant blind spot in our daily health checks. By automating the detection of pending system updates, we can ensure the underlying OS is always patched against vulnerabilities, improving the overall security and reliability of the platform.\n\n*   **Risks:** Granting elevated (`sudo`) permissions is inherently risky. A compromised or misconfigured agent could potentially damage the system. This risk will be mitigated by creating a highly specialized and restricted agent that is only permitted to run specific, read-only package manager commands (e.g., `apt-get update` and `apt-get --dry-run upgrade`). It will not be granted general-purpose root access.\n\n*   **First Step:** The first implementation step is to create a new OpenClaw skill or a dedicated agent that uses the `exec` tool with the `elevated: true` parameter to run the command `apt-get update && apt-get --just-print upgrade`. This will safely check for and list pending updates without installing them, immediately providing the visibility that is currently missing.",

This is the most severe finding and must be addressed.\n- **Empty Node Command Denylist:** The `gateway.nodes.denyCommands` configuration is empty. This allows all commands, including potentially sensitive ones, to be executed on paired nodes, increasing the risk of misuse if a node is compromised or a skill is malicious.\n\nConfiguration patch suggestions:\n1.  **Disable or Remediate Insecure Skill:** The `readwise` skill should be removed or disabled immediately until the code is audited and fixed.\n    ```bash\n    # Option 1: Remove the skill (recommended if untrusted)\n    rm -rf /home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/skills/readwise\n\n    # Option 2: Disable by renaming (if you plan to fix it)\n    mv /home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/skills/readwise /home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/skills/readwise.disabled\n    ```\n\n2.  **Strengthen Node Command Denylist:** Add essential security and configuration commands to the denylist to prevent remote tampering.\n    ```bash\n    # Run these commands to update the configuration:\n    openclaw config set --json gateway.nodes.denyCommands '[\"openclaw-config-set\", \"openclaw-config-unset\", \"openclaw-security-audit\", \"openclaw-skills-install\", \"openclaw-skills-uninstall\"]'\n    ```\n\n3.  **Review Model Policy:** The use of `gpt-4o-mini` as a fallback model is flagged as a warning. While not a critical failure, consider removing it from the fallback list to maintain a higher security baseline.\n    ```bash\n    # Example command (actual path might differ):\n    openclaw config unset agents.list.main.model.fallbacks 'openai-codex/gpt-4o-mini'\n    ```",
