My proposal is to address this immediately.\n\n**Proposal:** Investigate and resolve the OpenClaw Gateway outage. The immediate action is to restart the service, but we should also add a persistent healthcheck to prevent future silent failures.\n\n**Impact:** High. Restoring the gateway is essential for all agent functionality. Without it, no other tasks can be performed. This fix will bring the entire OpenClaw system back online.\n\n**Risks:** Low. The primary risk is that a simple restart does not resolve the issue, pointing to a more complex underlying problem like data corruption or a persistent bug. A restart might also interrupt any in-flight operations, but since the gateway is already unresponsive, this risk is acceptable.\n\n**First Step:** Execute `openclaw gateway restart` to attempt to restore the service immediately.",

The exact IDs depend on the enabled tools, but a safe starting point would be to block shell access and file system modification tools. A specific recommendation requires a list of available command IDs.\n3.  **Strengthen model fallbacks.** Replace `openai-codex/gpt-4o-mini` with a stronger model from the GPT-5 or Claude 4.5+ family to reduce prompt injection risks.\n    ```yaml\n    # In your config file under agents.list.main.model.fallbacks\n    - \"openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex\"\n    ```",
